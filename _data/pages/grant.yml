              The Seed Grants Program is designed to provide teams with grants
              up to $25,000 in USDC in non-dilutive funding to enhance the
              growth of the Starknet ecosystem. 


              This program has a simplified application and evaluation process, aiming to provide a decision approximately two weeks after submission.

              * Already developed an MVP or proof of concept.

              * Willing to submit a demo or links to a proof of concept or MVP.

              * Planning on using or building upon existing Starknet tools and integrations.

              * You’re experimenting with innovative concepts aimed at pushing boundaries of what is possible on Starknet.


              All teams should present a clear plan detailing how the grant will be used within the next three months.
